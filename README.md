## 🌐 Deployment

The project is set up for automatic deployment to Netlify:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Configure the following environment variables in Netlify:
   - `API_TOKEN` (Azure AI API token)
   - `VITE_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` (GitHub API token)
3. Deploy will automatically trigger on push to main branch

## 🔧 Current Working Features

   ```

### Required Files

1. **netlify.toml** (must be in root directory)
   ```toml
   [build]
     command = "npm run build"
     publish = "dist"
     functions = "netlify/functions"

   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200

   [[headers]]
     for = "/*"
       [headers.values]
       Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
       Access-Control-Allow-Methods = "GET, POST, OPTIONS"
