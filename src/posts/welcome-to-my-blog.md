# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings in the world of software development, AI, and product management.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a range of topics that I'm passionate about:

- **Software Development**: Deep dives into languages like Rust and Python, best practices, and architectural decisions
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Practical applications of AI in real-world products, including my experiences building Tan.ai and PlanGenie
- **Product Management**: Lessons learned from founding and growing startups
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Insights from building trading platforms and financial data solutions
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS, scalable architectures, and deployment strategies

## My Background

As a founder of multiple AI-driven products and co-founder of Vcrypt Software, I've had the opportunity to work on challenging problems at the intersection of technology and business. I'm currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at Oregon State University while building products that make a real impact.
